# Recreate a GitHub Repo Page

Recreate your github page, the repos tab specifically.
No functionality (search bar, sorting, tabs) needs to be built in
It should match as closely as possible. This will be a great portfolio piece
Try to match things as closely as possible. You will need to use all of the API's listed below   
and will need to write your own functions to calculate some of the information. As for where to start,   
I would get a layout up and running, then work on getting your data to the page, then work on the fine   
styling details. You have 5 days to do this, so pace yourself. Set goals and keep moving.
